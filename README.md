## RODE
I built a clone of the **RØDE**'s home page website using HTML and CSS and I used the tailwind framework to help with the responsive design of the website. and while I was working on the project the RØDE website looks great on larger devices, but on smaller devices, some of the div elements text is not visible. This is because the div background color and text color is white. I fixed those in my clone and built an exact same-looking home page of RØDE website.


> And I Finished this project in approx 10 hours.
